* Solarion Emacs

  Solarion Emacs aims to enhance the Emacs experience, mainly in Terminal mode. The whole README file is a symlink to =solarion-emacs.org=, and with =org babel=, this file could be tangled into different emacs-lisp files under =$HOME/.emacs.d/=.

* Installation

  *Clone the repository*

  #+begin_src sh
    git clone https://github.com/wang1zhen/solarion-emacs ~/.emacs.d
  #+end_src
          
  *Tangle the org file*
     
  #+begin_src shell
    emacs -q ~/.emacs.d/solarion-emacs.org
  #+end_src
     
  For the first time loading the org file, you might be prompted for permission of local variables, please type =y= to enable it.
  Then press =C-c C-v t= or =M-x org-babel-tangle= to tangle the org file into =init.el=.
  After =org-babel-tangle= is finished, =C-x C-c= to quit emacs.
     
  *Create alias for running emacs in terminal mode*
     
  #+begin_src shell
    echo 'alias e="emacs -nw"' >> ~/.zshrc
    source ~/.zshrc
  #+end_src
     
  *Launch Emacs and have fun!*
